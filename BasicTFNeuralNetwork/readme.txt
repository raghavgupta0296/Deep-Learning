Back to basics, creating a simple neural network to perform regression and capture the addition operation.

It works pretty well. Trained on simple 1-9 numbers but performs addition on any real numbers.

This is part 1 of experimenting with differences between basic and complex neural networks.
Next Experiment : Will a CNN, the networks which have the ability to recognize objects, able to perform simple operations like this model?
