Text Generation Using Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs) in Keras

Generate your own text through a model which can be trained on any existing text like a book or a conversation or anything.
The importance of Recurrent Neural Networks can be understood by this amazing blog by Andrej Karpathy :

Also this keras documentation will help:

For implementation in keras, I referred to this link :

Look into implementing temperature during the testing phase.

PS : For advanced study, read about Attention and Augmented Recurrent Neural Networks
